The library is made up of a number of modules that can be accessed by using `require('buildjs.core/modulename')`.  The list of modules and their purpose is outlined below:\n\n* `buildjs.core/regexes` - Regular expressions that are used within the BuildJS tools.  Prior to the creation of this core library there was a lot of repitition (and opportunity for error) with regular expressions in each of the modules.\n\n* `buildjs.core/formatters` - General formatting helpers (strip trailing whitespace, etc)\n\n* `buildjs.core/aliases` - Helper tools for dealing with BuildJS aliases.\n\n* `buildjs.core/platform` - Platform aware settings and helpers.",
